h1. GeoConvert

h2. A Module to convert coordinates

This is very much a work in progress. The LatLong -> UTM conversion is not working at all.

h3. Background

h3. Source

The calculations in this module are taken entirely from the Geographic/UTM Coordinate Converter page by Chuck Taylor: http://home.hiwaay.net/~taylorc/toolbox/geography/geoutm.html Any errors in the calculations are mine.

h2. Usage


require 'geo_convert'

easting = 717443
northing = 6.39756e+06
zone = 50
southern_hemisphere = true

GeoConvert.utm_easting_northing_to_latlong(easting, northing, zone, southern_hemisphere)
